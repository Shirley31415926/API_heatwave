# API_heatwave

This study analyzes public responses to heatwaves from June to September in 2023 and 2024 using Bluesky posts. We evaluate public attention and sentiment through post frequency and sentiment analysis, and trace how discussion topics evolved over time using topic modeling.

对我们的数据排个序叭

01是2023和2024年heatwave post frequency 获取（整理完毕）

02是2023和2024年EU，UK，USA 三个地区气温获取的资料（整理完毕）（需要额外标注，因为是在R language环境下搭载，所以会标红。）

03是将EU，UK，USA三个地区的气温数据和heatwave post frequency 进行correlation时间相关性分析（整理完毕）

04是北半球范围内的2018-2024年的数据获取和分析，以及温度和湿度异常值数据的获取资料（整理完毕）

05是sentimental analysis （整理完毕）

06为sentimental analysis 的correlation ，还需要更改统计方法和进行进一步的绘制ing

07.1为topic modelling （整理完毕）

07.2 output of topic modelling （整理完毕）

In this project, Xiaolin was responsible for the development of the Bluesky platform API, the extraction of heatwave-related posts, as well as conducting topic modelling and sentiment analysis.
Lixuan was responsible for the collection and organization of temperature data for the UK, USA, Europe, and the Northern Hemisphere, the creation of statistical plots for correlation analysis, and the writing of the Methods section.
Although specific tasks were divided, the overall coding and data analysis were carried out and investigatied collaboratively by both team members.

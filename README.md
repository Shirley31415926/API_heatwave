# API_heatwave

This study analyzes public responses to heatwaves from June to September in 2023 and 2024 using Bluesky posts. We evaluate public attention and sentiment through post frequency and sentiment analysis, and trace how discussion topics evolved over time using topic modeling.

后续需要将主题建模放上去，并进行分析
还需要将UK，USA，European数据获取的代码放上去以便于分析
